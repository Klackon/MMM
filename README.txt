https://github.com/Klackon/MMM
3. Go to the folder "Assets".
4. Go t the folder "Scenes".
5. Double click "Game.unity" to go to the game.
6. Click on the start button on top of unity to start the game.
7. Once the game starts, please press Enter.

Note: the functionality of character creation is there, where you can save the info of a player as a .txt file (some place holder), but it currently doesn't really interact with the actual game play, as we decided to use the remaining time focusing on the gameplay after spending quite some time on it.

To save a player's info, please open "CharCreation.unity" and play. Once you enter all info (these are place holders right now), press F1 to save the info to the same location as this README is.
