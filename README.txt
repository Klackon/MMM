To run the game, please
1. Download Unity.
2. Right now, you should have a copy of the game from the following repository:
https://github.com/Klackon/MMM
3. Go to the folder "Assets".
4. Go t the folder "Scenes".
5. Double click "Game.unity" to go to the game.
6. Click on the start button on top of unity to start the game.
7. Once the game starts, please press Enter.

Note: the functionality of character creation is there, where you can save the info of a player as a .txt file (some place holder), but it currently doesn't really interact with the actual game play, as we decided to use the remaining time focusing on the gameplay after spending quite some time on it. 

To save a player's info, please open "CharCreation.unity" and play. Once you enter all info (these are place holders right now), press F1 to save the info to the same location as this README is.

A Scout can now create an outpost on any square
Add scout and hunter texture, so they exist on game board
We later on for the last sprint spent our time heavily on the back end, and not so much on the GUI because most functionality requires back end, such as the City class, the data structure of the board, what a Scout can see given its position...etc. Unfortunately we were unable to complete GUI design for those. As our purpose is to build the basic of the game so other team might be able to build on what we have this semester, we shall let them take care of the GUI part.
